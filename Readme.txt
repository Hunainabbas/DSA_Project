Knight's Tour Visualization - ReadMe
This project provides a visualization of the Knight's Tour problem using Pygame. The Knight's Tour is a mathematical problem where the goal is to find a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

Requirements
To run the code, you need the following:

1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Pygame library installed. You can install it using pip by running the following command:
				pip install pygame
3. Download the image "Knight1.jpeg".
4. If you change the name of the image, change the image name in line 26. 
5. If your application gives you an error: "file not found in the xyz directory", then copy the file from the downloads and paste it in the directory specified. So that the image is in the directory and the code runs perfectly. 
How to Run the Code
To run the Knight's Tour visualization, follow these steps:

1. Download the code files to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.
4. Run the following command to execute the code:
				python knight_tour.py
5. The Pygame window will open, and you will be prompted to enter the size of the chessboard (N).
6. Enter the desired size and press Enter.
7. Next, you will be prompted to enter the starting position of the knight. Enter the row and column indices (0-based) separated by a comma (e.g., "0,0" for the top-left corner).
8. Press Enter, and the visualization will start. You will see the knight's movement on the chessboard, attempting to cover all squares.
9. Once the Knight's Tour is completed or all possibilities are exhausted, the final result will be displayed.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different chessboard sizes and starting positions. Enjoy visualizing the Knight's Tour problem!
